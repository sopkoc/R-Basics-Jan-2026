Importing data:

df <- read.csv("data.csv")
example: metsyndata <- read.csv("C:/Users/cjsop/Desktop/EAB_703/Metabolic Syndrome.csv")

Visulization - IF TIME

Scatter Plot

we can use different graph visualizations to answers questions that are interesting to us.
“Is bill length related to bill depth?”

ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm)) +
  geom_point()

we can add different colors to represent different species in this graph:
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm, color = species)) +
  geom_point()

we can also add labels to our graph:
ggplot(penguins, aes(bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm, color = species)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Bill Length vs Depth in Penguins",
       x = "Bill Length (mm)",
       y = "Bill Depth (mm)")

geom_point() → scatter
geom_line() → line
geom_col() → bars
geom_histogram()
geom_boxplot()

SUPER FAST STATS DEMO!
Do male Gentoo penguins weigh more than female Gentoo penguins?

gentoo_df <- filter(penguins, species == "Gentoo")

We compare body_mass_g between male and female Gentoo penguins using a two sample t-test becuase we are comparing two groups:

t.test(body_mass_g ~ sex, data = gentoo_df)

Male Gentoo penguins weigh more than female Gentoo penguins, and the difference is statistically significant.
