Let's talk a bit about Data Structures R has a few core data structures. We don’t need to know all of them in depth today, just the ones that help us work with data.

Vectors are really simple lists that are 1 demensional. The elements in the list need to all be the same (numeric, character, logical)
this looks like names <- c("Kim", "Cindy", "John") or scores <- c(95, 88, 97). 

You may also hear the word "factor" this is a categorical data like gender, species, or treatment group. These may look like characters, but behave a little differently
These are mostly just used for plotting or modeling data.

Data Frames/Tibbles are a table like structure just like you see in Excel or SPSS. The rows are our observations and the columns are our variables.
Each column could be a different element
Tibbles are specific to the tidyverse. You can think of them as flexible data frames that make it easier to print them out and work with them.

score_df <- data.frame (names, scores)

score_df
score_df$names
