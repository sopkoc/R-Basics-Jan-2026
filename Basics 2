Let's talk a bit about Data Structures R has a few core data structures. We don’t need to know all of them in depth today, just the ones that help us work with data.

Vectors are really simple lists that are 1 demensional. The elements in the list need to all be the same (numeric, character, logical)
this looks like names <- c("Kim", "Cindy", "John") or scores <- c(95, 88, 97). 

You may also hear the word "factor" this is a categorical data like gender, species, or treatment group. These may look like characters, but behave a little differently
These are mostly just used for plotting or modeling data.

Data Frames/Tibbles are a table like structure just like you see in Excel or SPSS. The rows are our observations and the columns are our variables.
Each column could be a different element
Tibbles are specific to the tidyverse. You can think of them as flexible data frames that make it easier to print them out and work with them.

score_df <- data.frame (names, scores)

score_df
score_df$names

Now we are going to look at some data!

we are going to look at our data a few ways the first thing we want to look at is where is our data in our RStudio. Let's look in our Environment Panel and you can see it there.
So one way to look at the data is to click on this small calendar or table button here. This will open your data up in a new tab next to our Editor Tab

Another way is to use some code.
Type penguins and run that

now this dataset lives in R, so we did not need to name it - we will go over that quickly at the end, but this dataset is named penguins

Great! Now let's use the glimpse() function

glimpse (penguins)
Each row is one penguin.
Each column is a variable: species, island, bill length, body mass, etc.

Let's only keep certain penguins we only want Adelie penguins in this new dataframe.

adelie <- filter(penguins, species == "Adelie")
adelie

So another way to write this is with something called a pipeline, which is a percent, greater than, percent sign.

adelie <- penguins %>%
filter(species == "Adelie")

You can also use other mathematical functions in there, so fo instance if I wanted all the penguins who bill length was greater than 45 mm

big_bill <- filter(penguins, bill_length_mm > 45)
big_bill

Now you try. Filter for only the Adelie Penguins that live on Dream Island.
adelie_dream <- filter( penguins, species == "Adelie", island == "Dream")
