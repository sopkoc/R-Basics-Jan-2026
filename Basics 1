To get started, we’ll spend a little time getting familiar with the RStudio environment and setting it up to suit your tastes. When you start RStudio, you’ll have three panels.

On the left you’ll have a panel with three tabs - Console, Terminal, and Jobs. The Console tab is what running R from the command line looks like. This is where you can enter R code. Try typing in 2+2 at the prompt (>). 
In the upper right panel are tabs indicating the Environment, History, and a few other things. If you click on the History tab, you’ll see the command you ran at the R prompt.

In the lower right panel are tabs for Files, Plots, Packages, Help, and Viewer. You used the Packages tab to install tidyverse. We’ll spend more time in each of these tabs as we go through the workshop, so we won’t spend a lot of time discussing them now.
You might want to alter the appearance of your RStudio window. The default appearance has a white background with black text. If you go to the Tools menu at the top of your screen, you’ll see a “Global options” menu at the bottom of the drop down; select that.

Let’s get going on our analysis!
One of the helpful features in RStudio is the ability to create a project. A project is a special directory that contains all of the code and data that you will need to run an analysis.
At the top of your screen you’ll see the “File” menu. Select that menu and then the menu for “New Project…”.
